# CryptanalysisToolkit
A classical cipher analysis and decryption toolkit. Uses heuristics in combination with local search (hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic) algorithms to find solutions to ciphers when a key is unknown. It can also attempt to find a solution using a partial key. This tool was created to tackle the 2017 National Cipher Challenge. Any participants of future events should not use this tool as this would be considered cheating since you have not created it yourself. Feel free to use it for other purposes.

## ['Light' Web Version](http://dulhanjayalath.com/decryptr)
A light-weight web version of this tool also exists [here](http://dulhanjayalath.com/decryptr). Be warned that the web version does not contain any analysis tools but can decrypt ciphers even if a key isn't known.
